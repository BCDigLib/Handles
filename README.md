Handles
=======

Local scripts and documentation for publishing handles.

Instructions on how to load the Handle GUI client can be found in HowToInstallHandleGUIClient.docx

A cheatsheet on how to structure a batch ingest file to publish handles can be found in Handle_Syntax_CheatSheet.txt.
The cheatsheet contains three basic templates that should be copied and modified for specific handle publishing.

extractHandles.sql and createBatchfromSQL.xsl are used when querying the Oracle DB directly.
